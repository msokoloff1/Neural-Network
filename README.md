#NerualNetwork

This project consists of a neural net writtin in java. My apologies for the lack of vectorization.

-- The constructor allows you to set the number of input and hidden nodes, as well as the number of output classess. The final parameter is a boolean indicating whether or not you want to load trained weights.

-- Call the train method and provide it the training set, number of training iterations, and the prediction set. The prediction set must be a single integer denoting the class that the example belongs to.
